This repository is a localhost implementation of a prototype of Stress Less! Stress Less is a website designed to improve user's comfort levels while driving, by allowing users to filter their routes to match their personal situation. There is evidence that anxious driving results in more traffic accidents, so it is important to create a sense of safety and provide options for stressed drivers! Example filters include: selecting routes that do not go above a desired speed, routes with adequately paved roads, and routes with less oncoming traffic at night to improve visibility. Since this implementation is just a prototype, only the speed filter is implemented!
